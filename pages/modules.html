        <h1>Modules</h1>

        <p>We have given you a brief introduction into a few modules over the
        past couple slides however now we are going to talk about exactly what
        they are and how they are used. </p>

        <p>Modules in Node.js work a little differently than they do in other programming
        languages. This is an artifact of the way modularity in JavaScript works. In client-side JavaScript,
        there is no notion of modules built into the language. Rather, one must work together a
        sort of hack to get them by dynamically modifying the HTML to include the required JavaScript
        files</p>

        <p>
        To maintain cross-compatibility with server-side and client-side JavaScript, Node created a
        system to abstract away this hack into an elegant function called "require".
        </p>

        <h1>Node Package Manager (NPM)</h1>

        <p>
        The node package manager (npm) is the program used to collect and install modules.
        in linux it installs modules in a folder called 'node_modules' in the current
        directory.
        </p>


        <h1>Creating Your Own Modules</h1>

        <p>Modules in Node.js look different from modules in other languages. We saw how to use modules
        in some previous examples, but we did not see how to create a module. </p>

        <p>To create your own modules in NodeJS, you use a special object called the export object.
        This object allows for the programmer to export different attributes and functions from
        the module.</p>


        <p>Let us create a couple of Node.js modules and see how they interact with eachother.</p>

        <p>We can start with a very simple math module</p>
