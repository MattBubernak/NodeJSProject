        <h1>Getting started</h1>
        <p>Like we mentioned on the previous page node.js is a server side application. Applications are written in javascript and so the first thing we need to get is the javascript parser.</p>
        
        <h3>Ubuntu</h3>
        <p>To install node on ubuntu you need to issue the command <code>sudo apt-get instal nodjs</code></p>
        
        <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
        <p>To install node on Mac you need hombrew and then you can issue the command <code>brew install node</code></p>
        
        <p>Once the interpreter is installed you can invoke it using <code>node &ltfilename.js&gt</code></p>
        
        <h3>Introduction Program</h3>
        <p>The first thing were going to do is create a basic javascript program to get us started. Thets create a file called helloworld.js</p>
        
        <pre>
            <code>
/*Prints hello world to the screen*/
console.log('Hello World');
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <p>Next were going to run this by typing <code>node helloworld.js</code> You should see the command line print "Hello World" and then exit.</p>
        
        <h3>Next Chapter</h3>
        <p>That is the basic introduction into node. Next we are going to dive down a little more into how to set up a web server as well as interact with nodes event queue.</p>
